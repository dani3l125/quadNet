# quadNet

Daniel Yakovlev, Daniel Greenhut

 This repository is an implementation for a group of independent experiments we had during our final project. The experiments are splitted between the ```tools``` and ```PiNet``` directories, where the important functions of generating polynomial systems can be found in the ```PNPData``` directory.
